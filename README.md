## Overview

This is my solution to the Testimonials grid section challenge on Frontend Mentor
. Frontend Mentor challenges help developers improve their coding skills by building realistic projects.

In this challenge, I built a responsive testimonials grid layout, focusing on:

Structuring semantic HTML for accessibility

Using CSS Grid to create a flexible and organized layout

Applying a mobile-first approach for better responsiveness

Paying close attention to typography, spacing, and alignment to match the design

The goal was to faithfully replicate the design while practicing modern layout techniques and strengthening my front-end workflow.

## My process

I started with a container div, then wrapped a content div inside it. Within the content div, I placed five child divs (with classes from one to five) to represent each testimonial card.

From there, I:

Used CSS Grid to handle the main layout.

Designed with a mobile-first approach, starting with a single-column layout for small screens.

Added responsive styles with @media (min-width: 768px) to adjust the grid for larger screens.

Used grid-row (and grid-column where necessary) to control how specific cards should span across the grid.

This approach kept the layout flexible, clean, and easy to manage across different screen sizes.
